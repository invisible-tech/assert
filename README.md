# presume

Assert library to allow one to throw custom errors.

It is just a Proxy for `assert`.

## Installation

Make sure `assert` is installed. 
The `npm` library `assert` is not a `dependency` in `package.json` in order to
allow one to use `Node.js`'s standard `assert` library.

## Naming things is hard

Presume was only of the very few names available on npm similar to "assert".

> Assume and presume both mean to believe something before it happens, but when you assume you're not really sure. If someone bangs on your door in the middle of the night, you might assume (and hope!) it's your crazy neighbor. If your neighbor knocks on your door every night at 6:30, at 6:29 you can presume she's coming over in a minute.
